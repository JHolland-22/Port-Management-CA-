# Port-Management-CA-
Created a Shipping Management Systems using Java and JavaFX to create a system where the user could manage a fleet of container ships, which can either be “at sea” or docked at one of multiple shipping ports. Every port can have numerous container ships, and a container ship can hold numerous amounts of containers.
